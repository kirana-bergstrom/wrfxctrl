Details
=======

The various parameters to control the initialization of the parameter are detailed here.

Short description
-----------------
A short description to identify your simulation.

Ignition location
-----------------
The location to begin the fire from can be selected by clicking on the desired location in the map, or by filling out the exact latitude and longitude of ignition in the boxes below it.

Ignition time and forecast length
---------------------------------
The fire can be ignited at any date and time, selected in the "Ignition time". The forecast length may range from 3 to 48 hours, but the simulation will begin at least 30 minutes before the selected ignition time to account for weather patterns.

Simulation profile
------------------
The simulation profile determines the horizontal resolution, domain sizes, and type of meteorological forcing used to initialize the weather model.
